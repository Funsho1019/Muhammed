Telecommunication is the transmission of information by various types
of technologies over wire, radio, optical or electromagnetic systems. It
has its origin in the desire of humans for communication over a
distance greater than that feasible with the human voice, but with a
similar scale of expediency, thus, slow system (such as postal main) are
excluded from field.
The transmission media in telecommunication have evolved though
numerous stages of technology, from beacons and other visual signals
(such as smoke signals, signal flags, optical heliographs and semaphore
telegraphs), to electrical cable and electromagnetic radiation, including
right. Such transmission paths are often divided into communication
channels, which afford the advantages of multiplexing multiple
concurrent communication sessions.
Telecommunication is often used in its plural form because it involves
many different technologies.

<p>The internet of things (IOT) describes the network of physical objects
“things” that are embedded with sensors, software, and other
technologies for the purpose of connecting and exchanging data with
other devices and systems over the internet.Things have evolved due to the convergence of multiple technologies,
real-time analytics, machine learning, commodity sensors, and
embedded systems, wireless sensor networks, control systems,
automation (including home and building automation), and others all
contribute to enabling the internet of things. In the consumer market,
IOT technology is most synonymous with products pertaining to the
concept of the “smart home”, including devices and appliances (such as
lighting fixtures thermostats, home security systems and cameras, and
other home appliances) that support one or more common ecosystems,
and can be controlled via devices associated with that smart system.
There are a number of serious concerns about speakers. IOT can also be
used in healthcare dangers in the growth of IOT, especially in the areas
of privacy and security, and consequently industry and governmental
moves to address these concerns have begun including the development
of international.

Trends and characteristics
? The IOT’s major significant trend in recent years is the explosive growth of
devices connected and controlled by the internet. The wide range of
applications of IOT technology mean that the specifics can be very different
from one device to the next but there are basic characteristics shared by
most.
? Intelligence
Ambient intelligence and autonomous control are not part of the original
concept of the IOT. Ambient intelligence and autonomous control do not
necessarily require internet structures, either. However, there is a shift in
